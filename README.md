# CreatoAI - app description

In this project, I developed a web application leveraging React, TypeScript, and styled-components. The application is designed to allow users to select a template for creating advertisements and then generate an ad based on a user-provided prompt. 

### Implemented Features
React's component-based architecture was employed for its efficiency in building dynamic user interfaces. The use of React allowed for effective state management and seamless transitions between different application pages.
Also, elements such as a slide selector for template selection and a dynamic loading feature for the ad generation process were implemented to create an engaging user experience.

### Challenges and Learning Opportunities
As a backend developer with no prior experience in JavaScript frameworks, this project presented several learning opportunities:
All these technologies (React, Typescript and Styled components) were new to me. The knowledge I had in HTML, CSS and plain JS helped me tackling these new concepts.
I have overcome these challenges by breaking them down into manageable tasks. Online resources, documentation, and iterative testing were key in my mission to learn.

### Future Improvements
Given more time, the following improvements would be prioritized:
- Advanced State Management: Implementing a more sophisticated state management solution (like Redux or Context API) for better handling of application-wide state.
- Integration with OpenAI API: The plan was to integrate the OpenAI API for dynamic ad content generation, but this was not completed due to the lack of an API key. (Even though I asked for one at the email address in the presentation) I did not recoeve amy response)
- Refinement of UI/UX: Further refinement of the user interface and user experience, including more responsive design elements and accessibility features.

Conclusion
As a backend developer, this project was an invaluable opportunity to dive into frontend technologies and broaden my skill set. 
The application serves as a testament to this learning journey. 
Although the quality of the code might not reflect a proeficient frontend developer's expertise, it represents personal growth and a foundation for future development in this area.
